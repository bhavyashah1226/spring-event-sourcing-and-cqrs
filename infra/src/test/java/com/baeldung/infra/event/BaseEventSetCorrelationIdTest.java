================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the UUID is being used as an identifier for sensitive resources, it may be susceptible to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). An attacker can potentially access unauthorized resources by modifying the UUID value.
Solution: Ensure that proper authorization checks are implemented wherever this method is used. Each request to access a resource with a UUID should be verified to ensure that the requester is authorized to access that specific resource.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid UUID Test

Details:  
TestName: setCorrelationIdWithValidUUID.
Description: This test is meant to check if the setCorrelationId method accepts a valid UUID and stores it correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a UUID instance using the static UUID.randomUUID() method.
Act: Invoke setCorrelationId with the created UUID instance.
Assert: Check if the stored correlationId is equal to the created UUID.
Validation: 
The assertion validates that the setCorrelationId method correctly stores the given UUID. If the method doesn't function properly, the stored correlationId wouldn't match the provided UUID. 

Scenario 2: Null UUID Test

Details:  
TestName: setCorrelationIdWithNullUUID.
Description: This test checks if the setCorrelationId method handles null UUIDs and doesn't throw a NullPointerException.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a null UUID.
Act: Invoke setCorrelationId with the null UUID.
Assert: Check if correlationId is null.
Validation: 
The test is significant as it validates the robustness of the setCorrelationId method, ensuring it can correctly handle null UUIDs instead of throwing exceptions, which could cause the application to crash. 

Scenario 3: Random UUID Test

Details:  
TestName: setCorrelationIdWithDifferentUUIDs.
Description: The test validates that the method setCorrelationId correctly overwrites the correlationId when invoked multiple times with different UUIDs.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two different UUID instances.
Act: Invoke setCorrelationId first with the first UUID, then with the second.
Assert: Check if the stored correlationId matches the second UUID, not the first.
Validation: 
The test checks if the setCorrelationId method correctly overwrites the existing correlationId, thus ensuring data integrity. If the check fails, then it could imply a flaw in how the method stores the provided UUID.
