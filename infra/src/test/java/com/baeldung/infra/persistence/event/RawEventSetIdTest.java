================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: The function setId() allows setting the id directly. In a scenario where a user has control over the value passed to setId(), this can result in unauthorized access to data. For instance, a user might be able to view information of another user by simply changing the id value.
Solution: Rather than setting ID directly, consider using a secure lookup function to retrieve data. Implement checks to ensure the user is authorized to view the data associated with the provided id.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control (CWE-285)
Issue: The setId() method is public and can be accessed/used from anywhere in the application. If used inappropriately, it can lead to improper data access (creation, deletion, modification).
Solution: Define appropriate access controls for the methods. Use the least privilege principle and limit the accessibility of methods and variables as much as possible.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validate setId with valid Long id
Details: 
  TestName: validateSetIdWithValidLongId
  Description: This test validates setId method with a valid Long id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class and a Long object with a valid id.
  Act: Call the setId method on the instantiated object with the valid id as parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the instance's id member was set correctly.
Validation: 
  To verify that the setId method works correctly when provided with valid input data. 
  This validation contributes significantly to the overall functionality and reliability of the application.

Scenario 2: Validate setId with null value
Details: 
  TestName: validateSetIdValueToNull
  Description: This test validates setId method with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class.
  Act: Call the setId method on the instantiated object with null as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the instance's id member was set to null.
Validation: 
  To ensure that the setId method can handle null values correctly.
  This validation is critical for cases in which the id of an object might be set to null due to some business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate setId with negative Long id
Details: 
  TestName: validateSetIdWithNegativeLongId
  Description: This test validates setId method with a negative Long id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class and a Long object with a negative id.
  Act: Call the setId method on the instantiated object with the negative id as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the instance's id member was set to the negative id.
Validation: 
  To demonstrate that the setId method accepts negative long values.
  This confirmation is significant as it ensures setId can work with any type of Long id, not just positive id values.
  
Scenario 4: Validate setId to change existing id
Details:  
  TestName: validateSetIdChangesExistingId
  Description: This test is to validate that setId method is able to replace the existing id with a new one. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set an initial id.
  Act: Invoke setId with a different id than the initial one.
  Assert: Assert that the initial id was effectively replaced by the new id.
Validation: 
  To verify that the setId can modify the current id of an instance.
  This test is necessary to confirm the method's ability to modify the objects id after it has been set once.
