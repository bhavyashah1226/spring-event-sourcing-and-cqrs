================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the debug information gets deployed with the application, a malicious user can gain an understanding of the system which can be exploited.
Solution: Remove debug information from the production release of an application, and ensure no debug code is left in the source code.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The software does not properly manage sessions, which can result in unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive information or privileged actions.
Solution: Ensure the session ID is changed anytime there is a privilege level switch, and anytime a user logs in.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: The software contains hard-coded password(s), which can be read by an attacker.
Solution: Do not hard code passwords or other secret information. Use a secure method for handling and storing data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test setting a valid transaction time

Details: 
  TestName: testSettingValidTransactionTime
  Description: This test checks if a valid transaction time can be set without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test instance of an object that includes the method.
  Act: Invoke setTransactionTime method with a valid time.
  Assert: The transaction time set is same as the passed time.
Validation: 
  A successful execution ensures the method properly sets the transaction time. This verifies the basic operations of the setTransactionTime method. 

Scenario 2: Test setting a null transaction time

Details: 
  TestName: testSettingNullTransactionTime
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle a null transaction time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test instance of an object that includes the method.
  Act: Invoke setTransactionTime method with a null time.
  Assert: The transaction time is set to null without throwing exceptions.
Validation: 
  The successful execution of this test confirms that the method can handle situations when no transaction time is provided, which may be expected in some use cases.

Scenario 3: Test setting a future transaction time

Details: 
  TestName: testSettingFutureTransactionTime
  Description: This test verifies if the method can handle future transaction times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test instance of an object that includes the method.
  Act: Invoke setTransactionTime method with a time in the future.
  Assert: The transaction time is set to the future time without throwing exceptions.
Validation: 
  A successful execution will confirm that the method can handle future transaction times, which is important for ensuring the flexibility and accuracy of transactions.

Scenario 4: Test setting a past transaction time

Details: 
  TestName: testSettingPastTransactionTime
  Description: This test verifies if the method can handle past transaction times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test instance of an object that includes the method.
  Act: Invoke setTransactionTime method with a time in the past.
  Assert: The transaction time is set to the past time without throwing exceptions.
Validation: 
  A successful execution will confirm that the method can handle past transaction times, which may be required in some cases, such as backdating transactions. 

Scenario 5: Setting transaction time multiple times

Details: 
  TestName: testSettingTransactionTimeMultipleTimes
  Description: This test checks if repeated setting of transaction times results in the latest time being retained.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test instance of an object that includes the method.
  Act: Invoke setTransactionTime method multiple times, each with a different value.
  Assert: The transaction time reflects the latest time set.
Validation: 
  A successful execution will confirm that the method retains the latest transaction time, as expected in real-life scenarios where the transaction time might be modified prior to finalizing a transaction.
