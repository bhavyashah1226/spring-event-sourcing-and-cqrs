================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unrestricted Access
Issue: Providing public setter methods can potentially allow unauthorized modification of object properties, and may violate encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
Solution: Use appropriate access modifiers to restrict access to setter methods. Consider making the method package-private, protected, or private as appropriate. Also, validate any data passed to setter methods before using it.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'setType' method accepts any string input without any input validation. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks if the value is used in a sensitive context.
Solution: Implement proper input validation to ensure only valid values are accepted and handled. This validation logic should be designed considering the intended use of the value.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: If the property being set by this method refers to a sensitive resource, it could allow an attacker to bypass authorization and gain access to the resource. This is possible if an attacker can guess or brute force the value of the string.
Solution: Ensure that access controls are in place and are properly enforced before any action is taken on the object identified by the 'type'.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful Setting of Type value

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulSettingOfTypeValue
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the setType method successfully sets the value for the 'type' String field.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare and initialize a String, e.g., 'TestType'. Instantiate the class where the setType method resides.
    Act: Invoke the setType method using the instantiated class and pass the initialized String as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual Type value against the initialized String value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies if the Type field value in the class correctly updates after invoking the setType method. An expected result will confirm that the setType method works properly.

Scenario 2: Setting Type field with null value

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingTypeWithNullValue
    Description: This test will check the behaviour of the setType method when a null value is passed as argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a null String. Instantiate the class.
    Act: Invoke setType method with null String as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the Type field value after invocation is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies the behavior of the setType method when a null value is used as its parameter. This will help to understand its reliability and error-handling.

Scenario 3: Setting Type field with special characters string

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingTypeWithSpecialCharacters
    Description: This test will check if special characters can be set as the Type field value, testing the method's flexibility.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a String with special characters. Instantiate the class.
    Act: Invoke setType method and pass the declared String as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual Type field value against the special character String.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies if setType method can handle special character strings. This will help us ascertain the range of string values that can be stored in the 'type' field. 

Scenario 4: Setting Type field with an empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingTypeWithEmptyString
    Description: This test will check how the setType method behaves when an empty string is passed as argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare an empty string. Instantiate the class.
    Act: Invoke setType method and pass the empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the Type field value after invocation equals the empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies how setType method handles empty strings. A successful test would imply that method can handle such edge cases.
